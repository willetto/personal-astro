Use @Sanity and @Astro Docs to set up the astro files in @features/ to be sections available in sanity studio.

The header and subheading should be optional text fields. If they aren't filled on sanity, then don't render them.

Any other prose should use sanity portable text.

For anything that is mapped or repeated code, make a card block or equivlant block for that element.

If there is an icon field, have a feidl where I can search the icons in @icons/ from inside of sanity. OR let me upload my own png or svg.

Keep all relevant tailwind classes, but also add a descriptive class name to elements.

Create a schema in @studio/ for these and make it so they can be added on any page. Write groq query for these.

Make it so any feature added to the home page will be rendered in @index.astro . It should respect the order of the sections and render any section in the order given by sanity.

Double check that there are no type errors in changed files.
