I'm Raul Chen, a Digital Marketing Specialist with a knack for using digital channels to amplify brand visibility and engage with target audiences effectively. My academic background includes a Bachelor's in Business Administration from Metro City College and a professional certificate in Digital Marketing from the Online Marketing Institute.

## Building Brands Online

My career kicked off as a Digital Marketing Coordinator at BrandBoost, where I spent four years mastering the art of online advertising, SEO, and content marketing. I then transitioned into a role as a Social Media Manager, working with startups to establish and grow their social media presence.

## My Marketing Approach

For me, digital marketing is about connecting with the audience in the right place and at the right time. It's about crafting compelling stories that resonate with people, driving not just clicks but meaningful engagement.
